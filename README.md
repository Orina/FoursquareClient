# Project  - *Foursquare Client*

**Foursquare Client** is an android app that allows a user to search for city venues. 
The app utilizes [Foursquare web API](https://developer.foursquare.com).

## Designing the app
The app implemented Model-View-ViewModel android design pattern in conjunction with Android Data Binding Library.
Shortly: MVVM+android data binding+fresco+retrofit+dagger2.

In this app the 
* ViewModel - is android.databinding.Observable from android data binding library.
* View - Fragment/Activities
* Model - classes defined in src/main/java/me/elmira/foursquareclient/model/ + Repository. The Repository receives/updates Models via memory cache/local datasource/remote datasource. Access to remote datasource is implemented with Retrofit library. Local datasource accesses only json file with cities list.

- When the app modifies the ViewModel in the MVVM architecture, the View is automatically updated by a library. No need to update the View directly from the ViewModel, as the ViewModel doesn't have access to the necessary reference.
- The Data Binding Library ensures that the View and ViewModel remain in sync bi-directionally as illustrated by the following diagram.

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X] The main screen contains a list with 5 cities of your choice (loaded from json file in assets)
* [X] When the user clicks on a city, user will be sent to a screen that displays a list of venues in the city (max=25). An item in the list should show the venue name, a thumbnail, location and categories. It should also indicate if the venue was bookmarked or not.
* [X] When the user clicks on a venue, user will be taken to a screen that displays a grid of photos for the venue (max=50). Screen will also display a Bookmark button. When user clicks the Bookmark button, update the button to selected state. When the user returns to the previous screen, it should update the Bookmark state of the venue in the list.
